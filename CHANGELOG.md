# CHANGELOG

## 2022-10-16 Late evening — storage planning
- Added a planner that recommends device tiers based on the shard count and risk level.
- Expanded the CLI so each bundle prints the plan and logs the suggested distribution for later review.
## 2022-10-10 Evening — project kickoff
- Captured the personal-wip idea for ShardWeaver Vault.
- Added README, lightweight CLI sketch, and core shard utilities.
- Updated gitignore, scaffolding, and usage notes to maintain a logbook feel.
